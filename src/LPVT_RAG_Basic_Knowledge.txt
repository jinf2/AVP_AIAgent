#1 Definition: Lumbar puncture is a common emergency department procedure used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. It detects CNS infections, malignancies, and inflammatory processes such as Multiple Sclerosis or Guillain-Barre syndrome. Historically, it has been used to diagnose subarachnoid hemorrhage when an initial CT scan is negative, although this practice is now debated. It is also used to manage idiopathic intracranial hypertension, with initial opening pressures guiding diagnosis. CSF samples should be analyzed for cell count, gram stain, culture, glucose, protein, and other specific tests to aid in clinical decision-making.

#2 Indication: Indications for lumbar puncture include:1. Signs and symptoms suggestive of meningitis (fever, headache, neck stiffness) 2.Altered mental status without other clear etiology 3.Focal neurological deficits with negative stroke work-up (e.g., Multiple Sclerosis or Guillain-Barre syndrome) 4.Evaluation for CT-negative subarachnoid hemorrhage 5.Signs and symptoms of idiopathic intracranial hypertension

#3 Contraindication: Contraindications for lumbar puncture include:1.Coagulopathy (including oral anticoagulants) 2.Thrombocytopenia (typically platelets less than 20,000 warrant transfusion before the procedure) 3.Known intracranial process causing mass effect 4.Cellulitis or abscess of skin over the procedure site 5.Suspected spinal epidural abscess

#4 Anatomy: Understanding the anatomy of the lumbar region is critical for performing a lumbar puncture. The procedure is typically done between the L3-L4 or L4-L5 vertebrae, where the spinal cord ends, and the cauda equina begins. Notice the superior iliac crests, which are at the level of the L4 spinous process. By palpating the iliac crests, you can identify the L4 level. The safest place to perform a lumbar puncture is at the L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspaces. The spinal cord usually ends at the level of L1, transitioning to spinal nerves in the cauda equina. Insert the needle between the spinous processes, directing it slightly upwards towards the patient's umbilicus. This angle helps the needle pass through the ligamentum flavum into the central canal, ensuring access to the subarachnoid space.

#1 Spinal Needle: Description: The spinal needle is a long, thin, hollow needle designed for precise insertion into the subarachnoid space to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Usage: Carefully insert the spinal needle between the lumbar vertebrae, typically at the L3-L4 or L4-L5 interspace, to access the subarachnoid space. Ensure the needle is properly aligned and inserted slowly to avoid damaging surrounding tissues.

#2 Manometer 550mm, Top: Description: The top part of the manometer is a crucial component used to measure the opening pressure of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Accurate measurement of opening pressure is essential in almost every lumbar puncture procedure, as it provides vital information about the patient's condition. Usage: Begin by attaching the top part of the manometer to the bottom part to complete the setup. The top part includes centimeter markings to measure pressure in centimeters of water. An assistant can help hold the top part to free up your hands while measuring the pressure, ensuring you maintain the sterility of the procedure.

#3 Manometer 550mm, Bottom: Description: The bottom part of the manometer is designed to work with the top part to measure CSF pressure accurately. Usage: Start by attaching the bottom part of the manometer to the top part. Once the manometer is fully assembled, connect it to the spinal needle to begin measuring the CSF pressure. Ensure the entire assembly is sterile and properly aligned for accurate readings.

#4 Extension Tubing 6": Description: The 6-inch extension tubing is used to connect the spinal needle to the manometer or the collection system, facilitating accurate pressure measurement and fluid collection. Usage: After assembling the manometer, attach one end of the extension tubing to the spinal needle and the other end to the bottom part of the manometer or the collection system. Ensure the connections are secure to prevent leaks and maintain sterility.

#5 Stopcock 3-Way Low Pressure: Description: The 3-way stopcock is a valve used to control the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) between the spinal needle, manometer, and collection tubes. It can be adjusted to open or close different pathways to manage the CSF flow. Usage: Connect the stopcock directly to the bottom part of the manometer. The stopcock typically has markings indicating which direction is off. The longer arm points to the direction that is closed. Adjust the stopcock to direct CSF flow either to the manometer for pressure measurement or to the collection tubes for sample collection.

#6 Specimen Tube: Description: Sterile collection tubes are used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples for diagnostic testing. Usage: Once the CSF begins to flow, direct the fluid into the sterile specimen tubes. Collect the CSF in the order specified by your institution’s protocol, ensuring each tube is properly labeled and handled to maintain sterility.

#7 Lidocaine 1% 2ml Ampule: Description: Lidocaine is a local anesthetic used to numb the skin and deeper tissues at the puncture site, making the procedure more comfortable for the patient. Usage: Snap open the ampule containing 1% lidocaine. Draw the lidocaine into a sterile syringe, ensuring you follow proper aseptic techniques. Inject the lidocaine into the skin and subcutaneous tissues around the intended puncture site to achieve local anesthesia.

#8 Syringe 3CC (Luer Lock): Description: A 3CC syringe with a Luer lock is used to draw up and administer the local anesthetic, such as lidocaine. Usage:Attach the 22G needle to the Luer lock syringe. Draw up the lidocaine from the ampule into the syringe. Replace the 22G needle with the 25G needle. Use the 25G needle to administer the anesthetic into the deeper tissues around the puncture site.


#9 Needle 22G*1.5: Description: A 22-gauge needle that is 1.5 inches long is used for drawing up the local anesthetic.Usage: Attach the 22G needle to the syringe to draw up the lidocaine from the ampule.

#10 Needle 25G*5/8": Description: A 25-gauge needle that is 5/8 inches long is used for injecting the local anesthetic into the tissues. Usage: Attach the 25G needle to the syringe filled with lidocaine. Use this needle to administer the anesthetic into the tissues around the puncture site.

#11 Band-Aid: Description: A Band-Aid is a sterile adhesive bandage used to cover the puncture site after the procedure.Usage: Once the lumbar puncture is complete and the needle has been removed, apply the Band-Aid to the puncture site to protect it from infection and promote healing.

#12 Sponge Applicators: Description: Sponge applicators are sterile sponges attached to handles, used to apply antiseptic solution to the skin. Usage: Saturate the sponge applicator with antiseptic solution and apply it to the puncture site in a circular motion, starting from the center and moving outward to ensure thorough disinfection.

#13 Gauze Sponge 2*2: Description: Gauze sponges are small, sterile pads used for cleaning and dressing the puncture site. Usage: Use the gauze sponge to wipe away excess antiseptic solution, blood, or CSF during and after the procedure. They can also be used to apply pressure to the puncture site if needed.

#14 Fenestrated Drape: Description: A fenestrated drape is a sterile sheet with a hole (fenestration) in the center, used to maintain a sterile field while exposing the puncture site. Usage: Place the fenestrated drape over the patient so that the puncture site is centered within the hole. This ensures a sterile environment around the puncture area during the procedure.

#15 Absorbent Towel: Description: An absorbent towel is a sterile, absorbent cloth used to keep the area dry and clean during the procedure. Usage: Place the absorbent towel under the patient’s back to catch any fluids and maintain a clean working area throughout the lumbar puncture procedure.

#Step-11 (Eleventh step) Cleaning and Bandaging the Site: 1.Carefully remove the spinal needle.2.Apply gentle pressure to the puncture site with a sterile gauze to stop any bleeding.3.Clean the area around the puncture site with an antiseptic solution.4.Apply a sterile adhesive bandage to the puncture site to protect it from infection.

First of all, let’s talk about some common indications or reasons you might perform a lumbar puncture on your patient. More often than not, lumbar punctures are performed in the emergency room setting. Sometimes, neurologists perform lumbar punctures in an outpatient clinic, and they can also be performed in the hospital, such as in the ICU or on the med-surg floor.

One of the most common indications is suspicion of meningitis. If we suspect that a patient might have this central nervous system infection — an infection or inflammation of the meninges — a lumbar puncture would be indicated. This procedure can reveal characteristic signs in the cerebrospinal fluid.

Another common indication, especially in an emergency room setting, is to confirm or rule out a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The most important initial diagnostic study for a suspected aneurysm rupture (e.g., a berry aneurysm) is a non-contrast CT of the head. Most of the time, this will show acute blood in a pattern consistent with a ruptured aneurysm. If the initial non-contrast head CT is interpreted as negative for a subarachnoid hemorrhage with an aneurysm rupture, a lumbar puncture is often performed to confirm the negative finding by evaluating for any evidence of red blood cells or bleeding in the CSF.

Okay, so those are the two most common indications for a lumbar puncture, especially in emergency room settings: suspicion of meningitis and suspicion of a subarachnoid hemorrhage in the presence of a normal CT scan.

Some other common reasons to perform a lumbar puncture include suspicion of other neurological conditions, especially demyelinating ones. The two most common conditions in this category are multiple sclerosis and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Both of these result in demyelination or damage to the myelin sheath and can produce abnormal findings, such as elevated protein levels in the CSF.

Another reason for performing a lumbar puncture could be for the therapeutic relief of idiopathic intracranial hypertension. This condition involves chronically elevated intracranial pressure for reasons that are not fully understood. In such cases, a lumbar puncture may be performed to drain a significant amount of CSF for therapeutic purposes.

Now, let’s talk about contraindications — the important reasons you might not perform a lumbar puncture or situations where it could be dangerous. One of the most well-known contraindications is a central nervous system lesion that causes increased intracranial pressure, particularly if this results in unequal pressure across different parts of the head. Remember, we have the falx cerebri, which separates the right and left hemispheres of the brain, and the tentorium cerebelli, which lies above the cerebellum and between the cerebellum and the temporal lobes laterally, as well as the occipital lobes posteriorly.

If there is anything causing increased pressure on the right or left side, or increased pressure in the supratentorial area compared to the infratentorial area, performing a lumbar puncture and releasing pressure below (in the lumbar region) could put the patient at risk of brain herniation. This is because the release of pressure in the lumbar area may cause the brain to shift and herniate. This is especially dangerous if there is increased pressure on one side versus the other or if there is pressure above the tentorium compared to below it. Brain herniation under the falx cerebri, under the tentorium cerebelli, or even the brainstem herniating down into the foramen magnum are all life-threatening situations.

This is why a head CT scan is often performed before a lumbar puncture to ensure there is no midline shift, mass effect, or loss of CSF cisterns, which could indicate potential herniation risks. Other contraindications include the presence of posterior fossa masses, spinal column masses, large brain abscesses, or tumors — all of which could create unequal pressures and increase the risk of herniation.

Another important contraindication is any infection at the skin site where the lumbar puncture will be performed. For example, if there is cellulitis or an abscess at the lumbar site, a lumbar puncture should not be performed due to the risk of introducing an infection into the central nervous system.

A traumatic injury to the lumbar spinal column is another contraindication. This can be an acute trauma, or it could be a past injury that involved reconstructive surgery or scar tissue, making the procedure more complex.

Other contraindications are considered relative, meaning that in urgent cases, some can be corrected before performing the procedure. These typically relate to coagulopathy disorders, such as hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, or bleeding disorders due to hepatic failure. These conditions increase the risk of bleeding, potentially leading to an epidural hematoma that could compress neural tissue.

Additionally, a platelet count of less than 20,000 is an absolute contraindication. Ideally, the platelet count should be above 50,000 to perform a lumbar puncture safely. If it's between 20,000 and 50,000, caution is advised, but below 20,000, the procedure should not be performed. Another contraindication is recent heparin use, whether unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin, within the past 24 hours.

If any of these abnormalities are detected on lab results, it is recommended to correct them before proceeding with a lumbar puncture. This can sometimes be done through administration of donor platelets or fresh frozen plasma to replenish coagulation factors, depending on the clinical situation.

All right, now let’s go over the contents of a standard lumbar puncture tray. In an emergency room or hospital setting where lumbar punctures are performed, lumbar puncture trays are generally available. These trays come as sterile packages, so it’s important not to open one unless you are ready to handle sterile materials. This particular tray is an adult or regular lumbar puncture tray, which includes a 20-gauge, three-and-a-half-inch spinal needle — a common size for adult patients. The contents of the tray are usually listed on the outside so that you can verify everything you need is included.

Generally, a lumbar puncture tray does not include sterile gloves, so you will need to have sterile gloves in your size ready before opening the tray. Additionally, the tray may or may not contain povidone-iodine solution, so be sure to check for that as well. Pediatric or infant lumbar puncture trays are available too, which include different sizes of needles and other adjustments.

Let’s go ahead and open the tray. You need to open it in a sterile fashion, being careful not to contaminate any of the contents. Peel back the packaging, making sure to open it in an area that allows for creating a sterile field. Open the paper wrapping by touching only the very edges and corners — never the middle — to avoid contamination. Be cautious as you peel the last part back, ensuring you don’t touch the contents. Once open, everything inside is sterile and should only be touched if you are wearing sterile gloves.

The tray typically comes with a fenestrated drape, which has a hole in it and will be placed on the patient later. It may also include a sterile towel that can be used near the patient's back. This particular tray does not include povidone-iodine solution, so if needed, an assistant, such as a nurse or ED tech, can open and pour it in a sterile manner into the designated trough.

The tray usually comes with three sponges. You will soak these in the povidone-iodine solution and use them to sterilize the patient’s back. When using the sponges, start in the center of the area where you plan to insert the needle and work outward in larger circles, ensuring the area is thoroughly sterilized. Once you’ve used a sponge, it should not go back on the sterile field; instead, discard it in a designated area without contaminating yourself.

Now, let’s go over the tubes in the tray. There are typically four labeled tubes, which can hold between 1 and 2 cc of CSF. The labels indicate their numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, and 4). Tube 1 is generally used for cell counts, Tube 2 for protein and glucose, Tube 3 for special tests, and Tube 4 for Gram stain and culture. In cases of traumatic taps, where blood is present in the first tube but clears by the fourth, Tube 4 may be used for repeat cell counts. The allocation of tests may vary depending on the facility, but this order is common practice.

Each tray usually includes a small vial of lidocaine for local anesthesia, often in a glass ampule. To open the ampule, hold the bottom firmly and snap the neck off at the groove, which is designed to break cleanly. Be careful, as the ampule is glass and should be treated as a sharp object. Once opened, place the ampule in a stable holder so you can draw up the lidocaine.

For drawing up the lidocaine, the tray often includes a 3 cc syringe and two needles: a filter needle for aspirating the lidocaine (to prevent glass shards from being drawn up) and a 25- or 27-gauge needle for injecting the lidocaine into the patient's back. Use about 2 to 3 cc of lidocaine for anesthesia.

A sterile piece of gauze is included for cleaning up any blood at the site after lidocaine injection. The spinal needle, which comes with a protective cover, is also included. The needle’s bevel is initially occluded by the stylet, which should be fully inserted when advancing or withdrawing the needle to minimize tissue trauma and complications.

The manometer is included in the tray and is essential for measuring the opening pressure. It’s measured in centimeters of water, with markings on the side to indicate the pressure. There’s an extension piece that continues the measurement up to higher levels and a stopcock for controlling the flow of CSF. The stopcock can be turned to open or close different directions, allowing control over the flow between the patient, manometer, and an open port for draining fluid.

An extension tube is often included for connecting the manometer to the spinal needle, giving more flexibility during the procedure. However, you can directly connect the stopcock and manometer to the needle if needed. Be careful not to move the spinal needle while attaching these components to avoid complications.

The tray usually includes a Band-Aid for covering the puncture site after the procedure, drug information for lidocaine, and labels for the CSF tubes. Make sure to label the tubes with patient information before sending them to the lab. Proper labeling prevents issues that could require a repeat lumbar puncture due to misidentified or unlabeled specimens
