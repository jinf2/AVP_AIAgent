Here's what you can do: gently withdraw the needle just a little bit and try redirecting it slightly. Make sure you're keeping the needle aligned towards the patient's belly button. This process can take a few adjustments, so stay patient and confident. You're doing a great job!\n\nTo see this step in action, you can watch these clips from the procedure for guidance.",

Understanding each instrument and how to properly handle them is vital for the procedure. You'll find virtual labels above each tool, which you can click on to learn more about each one. Once you're comfortable with the tools, you can move on to identifying the anatomical landmarks, which is the second step. Remember, accuracy is key, and don't hesitate to ask if you have any more questions!",
