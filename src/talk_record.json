Here's what you can do: gently withdraw the needle just a little bit and try redirecting it slightly. Make sure you're keeping the needle aligned towards the patient's belly button. This process can take a few adjustments, so stay patient and confident. You're doing a great job!\n\nTo see this step in action, you can watch these clips from the procedure for guidance.",
