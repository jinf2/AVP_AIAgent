In infants and young children, they should lie on their side with care taken to ensure their respiratory status is not compromised. For adults and larger children, they should lie on their side, curl their back out, bring their knees towards the chest, and tuck their chin down. Their hips and shoulders should be adjusted to be perpendicular to the bed without twisting the spine. This position is ideal for measuring opening pressure. Alternatively, in difficult cases, such as with obese patients, a sitting position can be used where the patient sits on the edge of the bed, leans forward, and rests their arms on a table or pillow. However, note that opening pressures cannot be accurately measured in this position.",
