Here's what you can do: gently withdraw the needle just a little bit and try redirecting it slightly. Make sure you're keeping the needle aligned towards the patient's belly button. This process can take a few adjustments, so stay patient and confident. You're doing a great job!\n\nTo see this step in action, you can watch these clips from the procedure for guidance.",

Remember, your goal is to find that imaginary line between the iliac crests and locate the L4 spinous process. Once you've done that, you should be able to feel the midline and mark it.
